= Fixed (testing files are in tested): =
  * 1. fix the bug when is_vararg==7
	varg_func.lua

  * 2. OP_SETUPVAL should use UPVALUE(b) instead of UPVALUE(bc)

  * 3. OP_VARARG should be R(A), R(A+1), ..., R(A+B-1) = vararg

  * 4. dirty hack to skip error caused by some numeric FOR loops
	for.lua

  * 5. NEWTABLE, SETLIST can properly process {...} and lists that use 2 or more SETLIST (n>50)
	setlist.lua

  * 6. SETLIST, {[123]=1,"123"=2} can be properly processed
	table_constructor.lua

  * 7. SETLIST, reformat the output
	table_formated.lua

  * 8. VARARG, RETURN, CALL, TAILCALL, SETLIST can properly use ... or return values as args
	varg_call.lua

  * 9. FOR nest IF can be processed
	for_if.lua , if_for.lua

  * 10. fix some memory leaks

  * 11. Full table support
	Data.luac

= Enhanced: =
new options to decompile a file to seperated functions, use them when a lua file cause the program core dump, you can decompile other functions.
  -nf num  decompile only specific nested function, use -pn option to get availble num
  -dn      disable nested functions being decompiled
  -pn      print nested functions structure and exit

= Know Issues (testing files are in error): =
  * 1. "local a,b = ..., ..." means "local a,b=..."
  * 2. "local ,a" means "local a"
  * 3. complex if..if will produce "do return end" ,that possibly means "else".
	ch4.lua
  * 4. complex while..while will produce "repeat..if..repeat --missing end".
	while_while.lua
  * 5. complex logic expression will produce a wrong result.
	logic.lua
