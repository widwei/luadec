If luadec.exe crashed, try luadec_memwatch.exe, and please send me the lua source or binary and memwatch.log.

----
==Fixes and Improvements:==
  # compelete table support
  # improved loop support
  # more clear disassembled results
  # read lua source files directly
  # options to decompile only specific nested function
  # process lua script with 255 or more functions
  # more stable and less memory leaks
  # can process consecutive 255 or more variable assignments

----
==Usage:==
  # decompile lua binary file:
    luadec abc.luac
  # decompile lua source file for testing and comparing:
    luadec abc.lua
  # disassemble lua source or binary
    luadec -dis abc.lua
  # -pn print nested functions structure, could be used by -nf
    {{{
luadec -pn test.lua
0
 1 
  1_1
 2
    }}}
  # -nf decompile only specific nested function
    luadec -nf 1 test.lua 
  # -nf -dn decompile specific function without sub functions
    luadec -dn -nf 1 test.lua

----
==Know Bugs:==
  # "local a,b = ..., ..." should be "local a,b=..."
  # "local ,a" should be "local a"
  # complex if..else may produce "do return end" ,that possibly means "else".
  # complex logic expression will produce a wrong result
  # performs badly on stripped lua binary files. use -s arg to test.
